# Student-Enrollment-Form

This project is a student enrollment form that stores student data in JsonPowerDB, a lightweight and serverless database. A student's roll number is used as a unique identifier for adding or updating their information. The form allows users to input, add, update and reset student information including roll number, full name, class, birth date, address and enrollment date. AJAX requests are used to ensure fast and seamless interactions, without the need for page reloads. JsonPowerDB's REST APIs and dynamic data storage capabilities are leveraged for handling the data efficiently.

## Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

•	High performance: JsonPowerDB is designed for quick and efficient data management with minimal coding effort.
•	Real-Time Processing: The database enables real-time data operations, making it suitable for dynamic applications.
•	Dynamic Schema: No need for predefined schemas. Supports relational data management without primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK), or unique keys (UK).
•	Versatile Storage: Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
•	REST API Integration: Low-code, HTTP-based REST APIs allow easy integration with multiple technologies.
•	Cost Efficiency: Reduces development time and costs by eliminating the need for database setup and management tasks.
•	Built-in Security: Provides secure REST API access for data manipulation.
•	Scalability: It can handle a growing amount of data without compromising performance.
